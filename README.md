It starts from a business operation improvement idea that is assessed versus of set of criteria to validate fit to use a Business Rule Management System, and addresses all the project implementation phases.

## Goals
ABRD applies the agile manifesto to efficiently implement business policies as executable rules. The goal is not having a team spending month to document thousand of rules, where those rules can be implemented, executed, tested in less time as soon as the first day of analysis. Specifically the goals are 
- Separate rules as a manageable artifact using discovery, analysis and authoring activities and work products
- Trace rules during their full life cycle from requirement to deployment and maintenance
- Link rules to business context and motivation
- Develop the rule description using business terms and high level rule language
- Prepare the fact model for the rule implementation 
- Prepare the rule set implementation and deployment as decision services in a Service Oriented Architecture or as Micro Services
- Articulate the rule governance processes
